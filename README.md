# rock_paper_sissors
A simple rock paper sissors game ran in JS 
This is my first real program done in JS. it was done as part of the Odin Project cirriculum. I attempted to create this program independent of other examples and get it funtioing though google searches. I feel like i learned a lot, and hope to get feedback on readability and functionality.
